This compromise on health highlights the urgent need foraccessible solutions that seamlessly integrate exercise into busy lifestyles. Time constraints make it essential for options that fit into fragmented schedules. Whether it's a quick workout during a break or a brief yoga session before bed, these solutions must adapt to accommodate limited time. By addressing these constraints,individuals can reclaim control over their well-being, fostering improved fitness and vitality within the relentless whirlwind of modern life.

The simplest solution can be provided by a fitness trainer as a mobile application.

### Approach: 
Our aim is to develop an app which helps a user to select workouts from a wide range of physical exercises and also helps the user to keep record of the number of exercises / repetitions of exercise performed. The app also assists the user with yoga and maintain proper posture, thus, providing a flexible solution to the above stated problem.
By utilizing the mobile camera, the app captures live video streams of the user performing exercises or yoga. State-of-the-art machine learning algorithms analyze these streams to provide real-time feedback on form and count the number of repetitions completed accurately by the user.
